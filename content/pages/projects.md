Optional Final Project
----------------------

The purpose of the final project is to get each of you something interesting to think about on differential equations, to learn theories/methods for yourself or with your fellow classmates, and to exercise communicating with other people by a mathematical writing.

You will study about your own topic for about two weeks and submit a report of about five pages by the last class session. Although the project is optional, if you choose to do one, it will be graded. By completing the project work, a student may earn up to 5% in the final grade. You are encouraged to work in group.

The project report must be written in a manner that a fellow classmate in 18.034 could understand what you have done and reproduce the work on the basis of what you have written.

Project Suggestions
-------------------

Some sample topics include:

*   Green's functions for the Dirichlet boundary condition;
*   Solution by a power series method and the method of majorants;
*   Smoothness of the initial value problem;
*   The stationary Schrodinger equation as a Sturm-Liouville system;
*   Numerical methods of solving differential equations;
*   Planetary motion and conservation laws;
*   Bifurcation theory and elastic rods;
*   Can one hear the shape of a drum?
*   Linear instability of a free-surface shear flows due to boundary singularity, etc.

Please feel free to come up with your own idea!
